description="Set up your joystick to control the CharacterBody3D. This node should be added as a child of CharacterBody3D, and you should configure your joystick in the Godot inspector (it comes pre-configured). How it works: The left joystick moves the CharacterBody3D, the right joystick rotates the SpringArm with the camera, the A button makes the character jump, the R button locks the camera, and holding the L button switches to first-person view. Thereâ€™s no need to create a SpringArm and camera, as this is already handled."
